      Here I would like to showcase some of my coding projects, obviously one of my big ones is this website.

      <h2>RetinexDL</h2>
      <p>Low Light Image enhancement convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model
        using retinex theory. Retinex Theory is the idea of splitting an image into an illumination
        map and a reflectance image. I generate a low-light image from a normal image and train the model
        only on those images. There is room for improvement, as this has some very practical cases.

      <h2>Trimet Data Pipeline</h2>
      <p>This is a data pipeline we built on Google Cloud using Pub/Sub and 
        breadcrumb data supplied from Trimet. Trimet is the public transportation
        system in the Portland metropolitan area. The github includes a link to a presentation 
        video.

    <div class="project-details">
      <h2>Music Recommender</h2>
      <p>This is a web app I made using Flask and Spotify API, deployed on Google Cloud Run.
        On this website you can sign in with your account, see your top songs and generate
        a recommended playlist based on your current top songs. Clicking on a playlist takes
        you to the playlist page on Spotify. (The website might not be accessible
        since my google cloud trial is ending soon)

    <div class="project-details">
      <h2>Heart Anomalies AI</h2>
      <p>This is a machine learner that can achieve at least 70% accuracy in classifying instances anomalous vs normal. 
        The data is based off this paper https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11583923/ by Kurgan et al describes diagnosis 
        of heart anomalies using machine learning on SPECT radiography data.

  <div class="project">
    <img src="Web Pics/projectsSS/bloom_feed.png" alt="Project 1">
    <div class="project-details">
      <h2>Bloom App</h2>
      <p>This is an Instagram Threads clone, with some changes to the color scheme and some other 
        features that I have now added. I wanted to change this app to be more so geared towards 
        maintaining good mental health on social media. Social media can be very harmful for 
        mental health. One of my original ideas for this app was to introduce an AI
        chatbot, more so geared to provide advice/therapy. I used Swift for building the UI, and
        using Firebase for user data management (chatting, users, posts, etc). This app is still in 
        development and there are still a lot of features I would like to add. This has given me a lot of
        experience seeing what it is like developing a UI for an IOS app. This was also good practice 
        for backend work seeing how login and logout and data managment would work.

      <h2>Flappy Bird AI</h2>
      <p>This is a project I developed in Python using Pygame. It is an AI that uses the NEAT algorithm to train the AI.
        Basically, it goes through generations picking the best genomes(gene) in each generation of X number of genomes.

    <div class="project-details">
      <h2>Super Mario AI</h2>
      <p>This is a project I developed in Python. This uses OpenAI's Gym 
        (Gym is an open source Python library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms)
        for reinforcement learning tools. They also have an environment specifically for Super Mario.
