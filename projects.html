      <h2>Bloom App</h2>
      <p>This is an Instagram Threads clone, with some changes to the color scheme and some other 
        features that I have now added. I wanted to change this app to be more so geared towards 
        maintaining good mental health on social media. Social media can be very harmful for 
        mental health. One of my original ideas for this app was to introduce an AI
        chatbot, more so geared to provide advice/therapy. I used Swift for building the UI, and
        using Firebase for user data management (chatting, users, posts, etc). This app is still in 
        development and there are still a lot of features I would like to add. This has given me a lot of
        experience seeing what it is like developing a UI for an IOS app. This was also good practice 
        for backend work seeing how login and logout and data managment would work.

      <h2>Flappy Bird AI</h2>
      <p>This is a project I developed in Python using Pygame. It is an AI that uses the NEAT algorithm to train the AI.
        Basically, it goes through generations picking the best genomes(gene) in each generation of X number of genomes.
