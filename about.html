          I hope you like my website. On the Photography tab, I have grouped my photographs by different sections so 
          they are better organized. For my videos, I might do the same but since right now I do not have a lot of videos
          I will just have them as is. I might add a description for my videos as well in the future to better describe my
          vision for those.

          Also Bare with me because this website is going to be in constant development and is more tailored for 
           desktop viewing. Some things on a phone or tablet might look a little bit wonky. Once I have more features
           and time, I will make it so that it looks good on mobile devices as well.

      <h3>Hope you enjoy!</h3>
