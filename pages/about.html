                    <h3>
                        Recently graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science at Portland State University, I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Portland State University. I am eager to gain experience in the industry. 
                        My college coursework has allowed me to gain experience with C++, C, Rust, SQL, Java, Python, and familiar Linux/Unix Systems as well as web
                        development tools such as HTML/CSS/Javascript. My personal projects have also allowed me to gain self learning skills and applying those skills
                        to my projects involving cloud systems, AI, and app development. I love working with others and want to expand my network. I want to learn as much as I can!

                    <h3>
                        I hope you like my website. On the Photography tab, I have grouped my photographs by different sections based on locations
                        or type of photo. My coding projects are also listed, and if you would like to look at the source 
                        code, the link to the repositories will be linked.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        This website is in constant development and is optimized for desktop viewing. Mobile viewing is being improved. 
                        Once I have more features and time, I will make it so that it looks great on mobile devices as well. I grew up playing Xbox 360,
                        so stylistically, that was my inspiration for the website.
                    </h3>
                    <h3 style="color: var(--xbox-green-light); margin-top: 2rem;">Hope you enjoy!</h3>
