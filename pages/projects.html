                            <p>Low Light Image enhancement convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model
                                using retinex theory. Retinex Theory is the idea of splitting an image into an illumination
                                map and a reflectance image. I generate a low-light image from a normal image and train the model
                                only on those images. There is room for improvement, as this has some very practical cases.

                                On this website you can sign in with your account, see your top songs and generate
                                a recommended playlist based on your current top songs. Clicking on a playlist takes
                                you to the playlist page on Spotify. (The website might not be accessible
                                since my google cloud trial is ending soon)

                            <p>This is an Instagram Threads clone, with some changes to the color scheme and some other 
                                features that I have now added. I wanted to change this app to be more so geared towards 
                                maintaining good mental health on social media. Social media can be very harmful for 
                                mental health. One of my original ideas for this app was to introduce an AI
                                chatbot, more so geared to provide advice/therapy. I used Swift for building the UI, and
                                using Firebase for user data management (chatting, users, posts, etc). This app is still in 
                                development and there are still a lot of features I would like to add. This has given me a lot of
                                experience seeing what it is like developing a UI for an IOS app. This was also good practice 
                                for backend work seeing how login and logout and data managment would work.
